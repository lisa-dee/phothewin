        Hi, I'm Lisa! 
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-subtitle>
          I enjoy pho.
        </v-card-subtitle>
        <v-card-text>I am no expert. I had my first bowl at the age of 22. 
        I have been enjoying pho for over 15 years now. I am a creature of habit. I order the same thing every time.
        I like to judge and compare across restaurants and I make sure the playing field is always level.
        I hope you get to try some good pho soon.
